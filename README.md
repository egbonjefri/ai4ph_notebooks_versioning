# COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis for [AI4PH](https://ai4ph-hrtp.ca/) Notebooks and Versioning Course

## About the Project

This repository was designed as an assignment for the AI4PH course, which provides learners with the necessary skills to work effectively with data science tools and hands-on experience in analyzing real-world data. The repository contains a jupyter notebook with code that covers various aspects of data analysis, visualization, and interpretation, using Python and relevant data science libraries.

## Dataset Overview

The COVID dataset used in this project includes data on the daily reported number of deaths involving COVID-19 by fatality type. The data include 

- Date on which the death occurred
- Total number of deaths involving COVID-19
- Number of deaths with “COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death”
- Number of deaths with “COVID-19 contributed but not underlying cause”
- Number of deaths where the “Cause of death unknown” or “Cause of death missing”

The data was sourced from [Government of Ontario Public Health Dataset](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/deaths-involving-covid-19-by-fatality-type/) .

## Key Objectives

- To provide a practical understanding of data analysis in the context of public health.
- To explore the impact of COVID-19 using various data science techniques.
- To demonstrate the use of Virtual Environments, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, and Matplotlib for effective data analysis and visualization.
- To use Git and Github version control as an essential tool for collaborative data analysis.

## Notebook

1. **Fatality Rate Analysis**: Focuses on the mortality rates and factors contributing to variations across different demographics.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive computing environment for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib**: Key Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Git/GitHub**: Used for version control and sharing the project for collaborative purposes.
